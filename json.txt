Steps to create Json servers
------------------------------------
1) create a folder for server
2) create package.json file
    npm init -y
server is run in index.js
3) install json server library
  >npm  install json-server@0.17.4
4) create .ignorefile
give node_modules
5) create JSON file
to create json file to store json data
here create a json file using any filename with extension .json.
and i used to display here as array of objects.
6) create index.js file(entry point to the server)
its only the file thats runs in the backend bcoz it is the file that is mentioned
it in the main key for package.json
   1) -'import json-server library' but here its json and 
    require is used for import the library
   ----- const jsonServer = require('json-server')
    2) create server using create function
    using create() method
   ----- const mediaPlayerServer =jsonServer.create()
   3) create path for database.json file
   using router() method
   ------ const router =jsonServer.router('database.json')
   4) create middleware to convert js into json
   middleware which have the ability to control request response cycle
   using default() method
   ----- const middleware = jsonServer.defaults()
   5)connect
   to connect we use use()method
   6)set up port for the server
   ---------- const port=4000 || process.env.PORT
   here we use process.env.PORT to avoid crashes. there are many default unique ports are there.
   7)run the server

content type - it is inside headers
--application/json we are uploding through links not from system
